    "a": [
      "GlyphLock is a next-generation security system that hides protected data inside images and QR codes.",
      "When someone scans or taps one of these images, GlyphLock checks if the interaction is safe, real, and untampered, then logs proof so ownership and integrity can be verified later.",
      "In simple terms, GlyphLock turns pictures into secure digital checkpoints that protect your business, your customers, and your data in real time."

    "q": "Why are QR codes a core part of GlyphLock?",
    "a": [
      "Because QR is the universal bridge between the physical world and digital actions.",
      "GlyphLock upgrades QR into a secure interaction layer with risk scoring, tamper detection, and blockchain audit, instead of a dumb square that just opens a link."

    "q": "Why do some artistic QR images on the internet look cool but do not scan well?",
    "a": [
      "Most artistic QR generators break the math that makes QR readable.",
      "QR scanners need strong contrast, quiet zones, and stable finder patterns. When art overlays blur those zones or change module shapes too much, scanners fail.",
      "GlyphLock solves this by keeping the QR matrix sacred and layering art in a controlled way, with a scannability meter and safe art mode so beauty never destroys readability."

    "a": [
      "Every code gets a risk score before you activate it.",
      "We flag punycode lookalikes, sketchy shorteners, suspicious domains, and payload tricks, then warn the user or block activation unless they confirm.",

      "GlyphLock compares what the scan resolves to against the original signed configuration.",
      "If it does not match, we log a tamper event, optionally auto-revoke the asset, and route scanners to a warning page instead of the real destination."
